Intro:

AI application is able to do it's own task without any human intervention.
eg: Netfilx --> Action Movie --> Recommandation is given by AI Application
    Amazon --> Iphone --> It may Recommand you Head Phones done by AI Application.
    Self Driving
These are done with out any human intervention which is done by AI Application.

Machine Learning is subset of AI, It provides a stats tools to analyze Visualize, prediction, forecasting.
Deep Learning is subset of ML, main aim is to Mimic human brain to implement/learn some thing.

Types of Machine Learnings:
1. Supervised ML - (Regression & Classification)
2. UnSupervised ML - (Clustering & Dimensnality Reduction)

Supervised ML:
Models learns with the help of independent features along with dependent features (Labels for Inputs or independent features).

Regression:
Whenever output or predicted value or dependent feature is continious value then that problem is know as Regression Problem.

Classification:
If our output or predicted value or dependent feature is one of the fixed no of categories, then that problem is know as Classification Problem
        If it is having 2 o/p categories then it is know as Binary classification.
        Morethan 2 -> Multi class classification

UnSupervised ML:
Model learns patterns from data without labeled outputs. It groups or organizes data based on similarites or structures.

Clustering:
Type of UnSupervised learning that groups similar datapoints into clusters. Each cluster contains data points that are more similar to 
each other.
eg: Customer Segmenation

Dimensonality Reduction: Reducing from higher dimensionality features to lower dimensionality features.
eg: PCA, LDA

Linear Regression:
