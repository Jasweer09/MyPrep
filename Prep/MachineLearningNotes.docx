Intro:

AI application is able to do it's own task without any human intervention.
eg: Netfilx --> Action Movie --> Recommandation is given by AI Application
    Amazon --> Iphone --> It may Recommand you Head Phones done by AI Application.
    Self Driving
These are done with out any human intervention which is done by AI Application.

Machine Learning is subset of AI, It provides a stats tools to analyze Visualize, prediction, forecasting.
Deep Learning is subset of ML, main aim is to Mimic human brain to implement/learn some thing.

Types of Machine Learnings:
1. Supervised ML - (Regression & Classification)
2. UnSupervised ML - (Clustering & Dimensnality Reduction)

Supervised ML:
Models learns with the help of independent features along with dependent features (Labels for Inputs or independent features).

Regression:
Whenever output or predicted value or dependent feature is continious value then that problem is know as Regression Problem.

Classification:
If our output or predicted value or dependent feature is one of the fixed no of categories, then that problem is know as Classification Problem
        If it is having 2 o/p categories then it is know as Binary classification.
        Morethan 2 -> Multi class classification

UnSupervised ML:
Model learns patterns from data without labeled outputs. It groups or organizes data based on similarites or structures.

Clustering:
Type of UnSupervised learning that groups similar datapoints into clusters. Each cluster contains data points that are more similar to 
each other.
eg: Customer Segmenation

Dimensonality Reduction: Reducing from higher dimensionality features to lower dimensionality features.
eg: PCA, LDA

Linear Regression:
The Aim of Linear Regression is draw a best fit line through the data points that should be minimal sum of all distance(difference between atual point and predicted point)
In order to get the best fit line we to update the Theta1 and Theta0 continously. In order to update it we need the cost function.

Cost Function:
it calculates the error between predicted and actual results. 
The goal of training a model is to minimize the cost function, so the model makes better predictions.

Convergence Algorithm:
Finding the Theta's value to update the cost function like increasing or decreasing the Theta value

Flow of Linear Regression:
Finding the best fit line with minimal cost function -> By continously changing the Theta 1 and Theta 0 values -> By using the
Convergence Alogrithm we can come to unknow like we need to increase or decrease the value -> with the help fo slope -> by using the
learning rate(alpha recommanded value = 0.01)

Local Minima:
We won't get the local minima in linear regression because our gradient descent and cost function won't get that chance, but in 
deep learning we will get local minima.
Local minima: there is some minimum cost fucntion values in gradient descent but those are not help our model to predict 
best prediction, we need to attain the global minima from that.
When we reach the local minima our slope will be 0 then our model struck over there. to solve this we have different gradient 
descents are there.
